This data is used to investigate the relative age effect in soccer. From the authors: "Relative Age Effects (RAEs) occur when schools and sports group children into age-banded cohorts. Within each cohort, older children study and compete at an artificially conferred advantage over younger children [1â€“3]. Since the start-points and end-points for age-bandings rarely change, such advantages are conferred consistently throughout childhood. Initial success tends to breed longer-term success for two good reasons."
