This data is used to investigate the impact of Uber on trafic fatalities. From the authors: "Ridehailing services such as Uber have been promoted as viable interventions for curbing alcohol-involved driving fatalities. However, evidence of ridehailingâ€™s impact has been mixed, with some studies finding no association but others finding either an increase or a decrease in fatalities."
